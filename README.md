Creating a README.md file for your project involves providing a clear and concise description of the project, its purpose, and instructions on how to use it. Below is a sample README.md for your phishing page project, which includes sections for description, setup instructions, and author information. I'll also mention adding images, though you'll need to replace the placeholder paths with the actual paths to your images.

### Sample README.md

```markdown
# Phishing Page

![Phishing Page](path_to_your_image_here)  <!-- Replace with actual image path -->

## Description

This project is a phishing page created to simulate a login page for educational and security awareness purposes. It demonstrates how phishing attacks can be constructed to educate users about the dangers of such attacks and how to protect themselves.

## Features

- Mimics a legitimate login page.
- Captures user credentials.
- Logs data for analysis.

## Disclaimer

**This project is for educational purposes only. Use it responsibly and do not engage in any illegal activities.**

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the phishing page:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/phishing-page.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd phishing-page
   ```

3. **Deploy the page**
   - Upload the `index.php` file to your web server.

4. **Access the page**
   - Open your browser and navigate to the URL where you deployed the phishing page.

## Usage

1. **Open the deployed phishing page in a web browser.**
2. **Enter dummy credentials to see how the phishing attack captures data.**
3. **Check the server logs to analyze the captured credentials.**

### Instructions for Adding Images
- Replace `path_to_your_image_here` with the actual path to your image files.
- Ensure your images are stored in the project directory or a subdirectory, and reference them correctly in the markdown.

### Including the `index.php` File
Ensure that your `index.php` file is included in the repository, and mention it clearly in the setup instructions.
